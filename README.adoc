These are materials for a tutorial:

====
"A Tour of the RISC-V ISA Formal Specification"
====

that was first presented by Rishiyur Nikhil at the RISC-V Summit,
December 12, 2019, and updated subsequently.  This tutorial is aimed
working engineers who may be _non-specialists_ in formal methods, who
merely wish to read and use the formal spec for various daily
practical purposes, such as:

1. Understanding each instruction's semantics, to make sure a hardware
  CPU implementation or simulator or compiler is doing the right thing
  (in the same way you might use a classic textual ISA spec document).

2. Use it as a reference RISC-V implementation against which to
  compare the functional correctness of some implementation (simulator
  or HW CPU).

The RISC-V ISA Formal Specification is written in Sail, a
Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying ISAs.  No prior
knowledge of Sail is assumed in this tutorial.

There is also a slide deck for a 1-hour presentation providing an
general introduction to the ISA Formal Spec.

== Contents of this repo

`Installation.{adoc,html}`:: This describes how to download the spec,
and optionally how to build an executable version of the spec.  For
use-case (1) above, it's a simple one-step git-clone.  For use case
(2) above, you will need to install some software and take some build
steps.

`Tutorial.{adoc,html}`:: This is the tutorial itself.  It assumes you
have gone through the download/installation process.

_Disclaimer_: Any errors in this tutorial are solely due to the author
(we welcome feedback on errata or improvements).

The RISC-V ISA Formal Spec in Sail was primarily written by Prashanth
Mundkur at SRI and Alasdair Armstrong at U.Cambridge.  The open
repository for the RISC-V ISA spec in Sail is:
https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv[].

Sail was developed at the University of Cambridge, UK.  Note that Sail
has also been used to specify other ISAs, including ARMv8 and parts of
x86, PowerPC, MIPS, etc.  The open repository for Sail is:
https://github.com/rems-project/sail[].

The above websites contain a lot more detail than is covered in this
tutorial.  People going beyond this tutorial and using formal methods
will likely wish to interact with those websites and their authors.

The Sail RISC-V ISA spec was selected after a year-long development
and assessment process by the ISA Formal Spec Technical Group of the
RISC-V Foundation (now called RISC-V International Association).
